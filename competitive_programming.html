    <h1>Competitive Programming</h1>
    <p>Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list to be sorted, compares each pair of adjacent items and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed.</p>

      <code>
        void bubble_sort(int arr[], int n) {
          int i, j;
          for (i = 0; i < n-1; i++) {
            for (j = 0; j < n-i-1; j++) {
              if (arr[j] > arr[j+1]) {
                int temp = arr[j];
                arr[j] = arr[j+1];
                arr[j+1] = temp;
